# Pipe.Net
A simple C# named pipe server implementation that can be used to share data with Node.js instances

Other projects doing something similar:

Edge.js
You can use Edge.js for full Node.js support from .Net. Edge allows in-memory sharing of data between .Net and Node applications. In contrast, Pipe.Net only allows .Net processes to send or receive data to or from Node using a named pipe.
